# SevaHealth AI
**AI-Native Preventive-Health & NCD Early-Warning Decision-Intelligence Platform**  
*Proposed for the Seva First Innovation Challenge (https://sevainnovationchallenge.in/)*  
*Problem Statement: Non-communicable and emerging lifestyle-oriented diseases*


## 1. Product Vision & Mission

SevaHealth AI identifies citizens who are silently progressing toward chronic disease, explains the physiological and lifestyle factors driving their risk, generates personalized preventive lifestyle medicine interventions, continuously monitors their trajectory, and escalates high-risk cases to healthcare professionals.

### The 8-Stage Core Loop
```
SCREEN ──► UNDERSTAND ──► RISK STRATIFY ──► PREDICT ──► INTERVENE ──► MONITOR ──► ESCALATE ──► MEASURE
```

### Three Stakeholder Tiers
1. **Citizen:** Mobile & web companion for guided screening, explainable risk factor breakdown, personalized 30-day preventive habit care plans, and smartwatch sync.
2. **Healthcare Worker & Clinician:** Field screening terminal for ASHA/ANM workers, high-risk triage inbox, AI pre-consultation SOAP notes, and doctor review sign-offs.
3. **Population / Public Health Administrator:** District-level epidemiological heatmaps, NCD prevalence distribution, and intervention outcome efficacy metrics.

python scripts/seed_data.py

# 3. Start the FastAPI Gateway
python -m uvicorn services.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Open your browser to:
* **Interactive Web Portal:** [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
* **Interactive Swagger API Docs:** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
* **System Health Probe:** [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)

### Option B: Containerized Run (Docker Compose)
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

---

## 4. Automated Testing & Verification

Run the complete test suite:
```bash
pytest tests -v
```

```bash
python scripts/test_e2e.py
```

---

## 5. End-to-End Platform Verification Flow

When opening [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/), an evaluator can verify the platform end-to-end in 5 minutes:

1. **Step 1: Citizen Health Companion** &rarr; Inspect citizen health indicators and biomarkers (HbA1c 6.2%, FBG 118 mg/dL, BP 138/88, BMI 27.2) and active preventive indicators.
2. **Step 2: Preventive Screening** &rarr; Inspect integrated CBAC and IDRS risk surveys via the Take Self-Check modal or Field Worker Intake.
3. **Step 3: Multi-Factor Risk Assessment** &rarr; View composite risk (*HIGH: 61%*), prediabetes probability (*65%*), and prehypertension risk (*60%*).
4. **Step 4: Explainability Waterfall** &rarr; Understand top drivers: *+22% Impaired Glycemia (HbA1c 6.2%)*, *+18% Vascular Pressure (138/88 mmHg)*, and protective factors (*-15% Tobacco Abstinence*). Notice the clear safety disclaimer: *"Clinical review recommended"*.
5. **Step 5: 30-Day Preventive Care Plan** &rarr; Review tailored nutrition guidance (swapping white rice with foxtail millet/ragi) and click to check off daily habit tasks, watching adherence update live.
6. **Step 6: Wearable Biometrics Sync** &rarr; Click "Sync Wearables" to ingest 14 days of normalized smartwatch telemetry (Resting HR, HRV, sleep stages, daily steps).
7. **Step 7: Clinician Triage Review** &rarr; Switch to the Clinician tab. Review *Lakshmi Devi* (escalated for Stage 2 HTN 164/98 mmHg), inspect the AI-drafted pre-consult SOAP note, and click **"Doctor Sign-off & Approve Care Plan"**.
8. **Step 8: Population Intelligence** &rarr; Switch to the Population Health tab. View district heatmaps and verify the **Outcome Efficacy Delta**: Citizens with &ge;75% adherence achieved an average **-6.4 mmHg systolic BP drop** and **-14.2 mg/dL fasting glucose reduction** over 30 days!

### Environment Baseline & Repeatability (TC-DEP-005)

To restore clean initial database baseline and verify repeatability with 100% determinism:

* **Interactive Web Portal**: Navigate to **Deployment Verification** &rarr; Click **"5. Baseline Reset"** &rarr; Click **"Reset Environment Baseline"** (triggers `/api/v1/deployment/demo-reset-audit`).
* **Command Line Interface**:
  ```bash
  # Option 1: Seed Data Baseline Reset
  python scripts/seed_data.py --reset

  # Option 2: Automated End-to-End Verification
  python scripts/test_e2e.py
  ```

---

## 6. Clinical Safety & Governance

SevaHealth AI is strictly non-diagnostic:
* **AI may:** Stratify preventive risk, explain physiological drivers, formulate lifestyle medicine habits, summarize pre-consult history, and flag critical thresholds.
* **AI must NOT:** Autonomously diagnose disease, prescribe pharmaceutical medications, titrate dosages, or issue medical orders.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** All escalated cases require licensed physician sign-off. Probabilistic risk is never presented as a confirmed medical condition.

---

## 7. Open-Source Reuse & Attribution Matrix

In compliance with open-source licensing, all eleven upstream reference repositories are documented in [`docs/REUSE_MATRIX.md`](docs/REUSE_MATRIX.md) and [`docs/repository-reuse-analysis.md`](docs/repository-reuse-analysis.md). No copyright notices have been removed:

## 4. THREE MAIN USER ROLES

### A. Citizen
- Health profile and screening
- Risk assessment results
- Preventive care plan
- Daily habit check-ins
- Wearable data integration

### B. Health Worker / Clinician
- CBAC/IDRS screening
- High-risk patient triage
- Patient health information
- AI-assisted SOAP notes
- Doctor review and sign-off
- Referral management

### C. Public Health Administrator
- District-level health analytics
- NCD distribution
- Epidemiological heatmaps
- Cohort outcome measurements

**Memory Trick:** Citizen → Care Team → Community Dashboard.

---

## 5. EIGHT-STAGE HEALTHCARE WORKFLOW

1. SCREEN — Screening data collect karna.
2. UNDERSTAND — Patient history, lifestyle and measurements understand karna.
3. RISK STRATIFY — Risk score aur category determine karna.
4. PREDICT — Available data se potential risks assess karna.
5. INTERVENE — Preventive care plan generate/support karna.
6. MONITOR — Check-ins aur health trends track karna.
7. ESCALATE — Appropriate alerts aur referrals support karna.
8. MEASURE — Progress aur outcomes evaluate karna.

**Memory Trick:**
Screen → Understand → Score → Predict → Prevent → Monitor → Escalate → Measure.

Risk assessment ko confirmed medical diagnosis nahi samajhna chahiye.

## 11. INTERVIEW QUESTIONS — SHORT ANSWERS

Q1. What is SevaHealth AI?

It is an AI-assisted preventive healthcare platform designed to support early NCD risk identification and preventive care planning.

Q2. Why did you use FastAPI?

FastAPI provides Python-based API development, request validation and automatic interactive API documentation.

Q3. Why PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL supports relational data, constraints, transactions and JSONB for flexible data structures.

Q4. What are NCDs?

NCDs are non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases.

Q5. What is risk stratification?

It means classifying people into risk categories to help prioritize appropriate follow-up.

Q6. What is explainable AI?

It helps people understand the factors contributing to an AI model's output instead of presenting only a result.

Q7. What is a SOAP note?

SOAP stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan. It is a structured format for clinical documentation.

Q8. What is CBAC/IDRS?

They are screening approaches used in India for community health risk assessment and diabetes risk screening.

Q9. What is JSONB?

JSONB is a PostgreSQL data type for storing and querying JSON data in a binary representation.

Q10. What is a database migration?

It is a controlled change to a database schema, such as creating a table or adding a column.

Q11. What is end-to-end testing?

It checks whether multiple connected parts of an application work together through a complete workflow.

Q12. What is Docker?

Docker packages an application and its dependencies into containers for consistent execution across environments.

Q13. How does the application help healthcare workers?

It supports screening, patient-risk review, triage, clinical note drafting and referral workflows.

Q14. Is AI making the final medical decision?

The intended role is decision support. Clinical assessment and medical decisions require qualified healthcare professionals.

Q15. How do you start the project?

I open PowerShell in the project directory and run .\run.ps1 dev, then access the local portal and Swagger documentation.
